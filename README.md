The "Cross the Roads" game is a simple yet captivating 2D grid-based arcade game developed using C++. The objective of the game is to guide a player character represented by the letter 'V' safely across a busy road with multiple lanes filled with moving cars represented by the character '#'. The player must avoid colliding with the cars while crossing the lanes. The game also features a scoring system, where the player earns points for successfully reaching the other side of the road.

Key Features:

2D Grid-Based Environment: The game takes place in a grid-based environment, where each cell represents a lane or a position for the player character.
Intuitive Controls: Players can control the character's movement using keyboard keys 'a', 'd', 'w', and 's' for left, right, up, and down movements, respectively.
Randomized Traffic Movement: The traffic in each lane is randomized, with cars moving in either direction (left to right or right to left) at varying speeds, making the game challenging and unpredictable.
Scoring System: Players earn points for successfully crossing the road and reaching the other side without colliding with any cars.
Increasing Difficulty: As the player progresses, the game becomes more challenging with increased traffic and faster car movements, testing the player's reflexes and agility.
The "Cross the Roads" game project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts, including object-oriented design, memory management using classes and pointers, and user input handling. With its engaging gameplay and addictive mechanics, the game offers a fun and entertaining experience for players of all ages.
